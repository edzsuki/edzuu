		<h1>Internet and the World Wide Web</h1>
		<p>Many people use the term <b>Internet</b> and the <b>World Wide Web</b> interchangeably, but in fact, the two terms are not synonymous. 
		The Internet and the World Wide Web are two separated but related things.</p>
		
		<p>The <b>Internet</b> is a massive network of networks, a networking infrastructure. 
		It connects millions of computers together globally, forming a network in which any computer can communicate with other computers as long as they are both connected to the internet. 
		Information can travel via the internet via a variety of languages called <i>"Protocols"</i>.</p>

		<p>The <b>World Wide Web</b> or simply <i>"Web"</i>, is a way of accessing information over the medium of the internet. 
		It is an information-sharing model that is built on top of the internet. 
		The Web uses the <b>HTTP protocol</b>, only one of the languages spoken over the internet, to transmit data.</p>
