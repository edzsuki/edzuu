  <h1> AI Voice and its dangers to the Voice-Acting Industry </h1>
  <p> Artificial Intelligence has been proven an advantage and a danger in different creative industries. One industry it has been disruptive against is the voice-acting industry, where actors have been sounding the alarm on the new artificial technology that makes replicas of their voices. Several voice actors have voiced their concerns when it comes to this technology, and remains a threat in the future of voice acting.</p>

  <p> Many businesses now provide AI-based methods for voice-overs. Usually, they operate by having users record their voices while following a script. A copy of the user's voice is produced once a predetermined amount of audio has been captured. After that, users may enter any text into a text field and have it speak the words back to them. This technology have proven its dangers to voice-actors all over the globe, which made them increase their concern for this technology.
</p>

  <h2> Voice Acting Industy's concerns </h2>
 <p1> Hollywood and video game voice actors have been asked to sign contracts that give up their rights to use their voices on generative AI. They have said that this technique can potentially destroy facets in the industry. This technology also has been dangerous in terms of potentially squeezing out performances without properly compensating these voice actors. As well as the potential mistreatment of these voice actors, this AI voice generated tool can promote mis and disinformation across social media and new outlets. </p1>

<p2> There's no denying that AI voice over IP technology will gain more popularity in spite of obstacles and hindrances. It's possible that as the AI Voice Over technology advances, an increasing number of businesses may start using AI-generated voices to create content fast and affordably. As the demand of AI voice over rises, the demand of human voice acting performances will lower. The competition would be tougher, as these voice actors might soon have to compete with machines for jobs; although technology is not perfect yet, it is advancing swiftly. </p2>  

  <h3> SAG-AFTRA's Response </h3>
  <p3> In response to the alarming rate of the usage of AI generated voice, Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists released a letter that had stated that: </p3>

  <p4> <br><br> “SAG-AFTRA maintains that the right to digitally replicate a performer's voice or likeness to substantially manipulate a performance, or to create a new digital performance, is a mandatory subject of bargaining. In addition, the use of performer’s voice, likeness or performance to train an artificial intelligence system designed to generate new visual, audio, or audiovisual content is a mandatory subject of bargaining.” </p4>
  
  <p5> <br><br> It had also mentioned that ones who are using voice actors have a right to negotiate and agree on how this technology would be used, and that SAG-AFTRA believes that taking away these rights is not valid and enforceable.</p5>
  
  <p6> This statement has emphasized that these voice actors and the voice acting industry have rights when it comes to this dangerous yet intriguing technology, and that this innovation can never replace human voices, and can never duplicate the emotional depth that these voice actors portray in video games and films. </p6>
